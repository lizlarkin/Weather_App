<h1>Weather_App</h1>
<h2>Dynamic weather app using data from Open Weather API</h2>

This project connects to Open Weather API to generate a dynamic weather app. The user can search
for a city and the app will return the current weather and 5-day forecast. The user's search is
saved for as long as they're on the page (it is cleared upon a page refresh), and the user can
click on a previously searched city to pull up that city's weather data again.

This project was my first introduction to APIs, and also served to really reinforce dynamically
generating HTML and dynamically styling through Javascript. 

Languages/tools utilized include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascipt, and JQuery.
